# Remote landing controller for Drone:bit

## Use
Use with other code specified in Microbit-Education to create a remote landing controller for the dronebit. Will need a second microbit to use as the remote controller.

**To land:** press A+B buttons

## LEDs
The status of the controller can be understood by looking at the LEDs.

When first turning on, you should see "..." and then "&check;" after the remote controller been set to the correct radio group (33) and is ready to go. 

After the remote land button (A+B) is pressed, the LEDs will show ":("

If the drone acknowledges and confirms the remote landing interrupt, then the LEDs will display ":)". Continue to use the remote landing control as normal.
